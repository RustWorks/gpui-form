## i18n
i18n resources

## some-lib
our crate types

## some-lib-forms
crate to hold the gpui forms, also has a main.rs defining a storybook-like gpui app, showcasing the forms

## prototyping
our own prototyping tool for generating the forms, defining items that we would otherwise have to write ourselves.
